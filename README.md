## Project Introduction:
We are building a smart trading bot using **Rust** to analyze market data and make data-driven financial decisions. The bot will leverage machine learning techniques, specifically reinforcement learning, to continuously improve its trading strategies. The system will autonomously predict market trends and execute buy, sell, or hold actions based on real-time market conditions.

Our project aims to explore the use of AI in finance, creating an efficient and adaptable trading bot that can make smarter decisions over time. By using **Rust** for performance and efficiency, we ensure that the bot responds quickly to market changes, making it suitable for real-time trading.

### Goals and Objectives:
- **Create an adaptive trading bot**: The bot will use reinforcement learning to decide on buy, sell, or hold actions based on market trends.
- **Implement risk management**: Features like stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing will be incorporated to ensure safe and profitable trading.
- **Train the model to evolve**: The bot will learn from both real-time data and historical market conditions, optimizing its strategies over time.
- **Backtesting and simulation**: Before live deployment, we’ll simulate and backtest the bot's strategies on historical data to evaluate its performance.

## Technical Overview:
The project will be divided into several core components, each contributing to the overall functionality of the trading bot:

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- **Market Data**: We will pull real-time market data from APIs (such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage) using Rust libraries for HTTP requests (e.g., `reqwest`).
- **Technical Indicators**: The bot will use common indicators like moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and Bollinger Bands to process and prepare the data for machine learning.

### 2. Machine Learning (Reinforcement Learning):
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: We will use RL to train the bot to take actions (buy, sell, hold) that maximize cumulative reward (i.e., profit) over time.
- **State Representation**: The state of the market (e.g., prices, technical indicators) will be fed to the RL model to predict the best action.
- **Training**: The bot will interact with historical data, receiving feedback on its actions (profits or losses) to improve its strategies through trial and error.

### 3. Trading Strategy Engine:
- **Buy/Sell Decisions**: The bot will decide when to buy or sell based on the signals generated by the AI model (e.g., moving averages crossing or RSI thresholds).
- **Hold Decision**: If no strong signals are found, the bot will hold the current position, reducing unnecessary trades.
- **Risk Management**: The trading engine will include stop-loss, take-profit, and portfolio balancing rules to manage risk and protect against large losses.

### 4. Backtesting and Performance Evaluation:
- **Backtesting**: We will test the bot on historical market data to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies. The bot’s decisions will be simulated to measure its profitability.
- **Performance Metrics**: We’ll track key metrics like cumulative returns, win rate, and drawdown to assess the bot's performance.

## Checkpoints:

### **Checkpoint 1 (Week 1-2)**:
- Set up the Rust environment and integrate APIs for pulling market data (using libraries like `reqwest`).
- Start preprocessing the data to calculate basic technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI).
- Implement the basic skeleton of the reinforcement learning algorithm, setting up the model to make simple buy/sell decisions.

### **Checkpoint 2 (Week 3-4)**:
- Train the RL model using historical data, and begin evaluating buy/sell decisions using backtesting.
- Implement basic risk management features like stop-loss and take-profit.
- Develop initial trading logic for executing buy, sell, and hold actions.

### **Checkpoint 3 (Week 5-6)**:
- Refine the RL model, optimize the reward function, and adjust hyperparameters for better performance.
- Integrate position sizing and portfolio balancing logic to manage risk.
- Test the bot’s performance with extended backtesting and simulation.

### **Checkpoint 4 (Week 7-8)**:
- Finalize risk management and refine decision-making based on performance metrics.
- Perform real-time testing and simulation to evaluate the bot's behavior under live market conditions.
- Optimize the system for performance and handle edge cases.

## Possible Challenges:
- **Rust and Machine Learning**: While Rust is fast and efficient, it is not as widely used for machine learning as Python. Finding or building libraries for RL and machine learning may present challenges, but we can utilize Rust's FFI (foreign function interface) to integrate with other languages if needed.
  
- **Market Volatility**: The financial markets are unpredictable, and the bot’s ability to adapt to sudden changes or extreme volatility is critical. Ensuring robust performance in changing market conditions will be challenging.

- **Data Quality**: Accessing accurate and clean real-time data is essential. API limitations or missing data could lead to incorrect predictions or poor trading decisions.

- **Debugging in Real-time**: The bot will need to operate in real-time, and debugging such a system, especially when things go wrong with actual trades, could be challenging. Testing thoroughly in simulated environments will be crucial.
